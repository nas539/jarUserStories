Instructions
For the Soup
Preheat oven to 450F. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss potatoes and carrots with 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper; spread in an even layer.
Bake until browned, about 15 minutes, tossing with a spatula halfway through cooking. Set aside.
In a Dutch oven, add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle bacon in an even layer.
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove bacon using a slotted spoon, and set aside.
Sprinkle chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper; cook in batches until just browned, about 3 minutes.
Remove chicken from pan using a slotted spoon. Set aside.
Add onion, celery, and garlic to pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add butter; let melt. Sprinkle in flour; stir to coat vegetables, and let cook one minute, stirring constantly.
Gradually add stock, whisking constantly. Add milk, and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium low; add chicken, carrots, potato, and thyme.
Let simmer until thick and creamy, about 10 minutes.
Stir in peas; taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if desired.
Sprinkle servings with bacon; serve with Thyme-Parmesan Crackers.
For the Thyme-Parmesan Crackers
Preheat oven to 400F. Unfold puff pastry sheet; place on a piece of parchment paper.
Roll with a rolling pin to smooth out seams and flatten slightly.
Whisk together egg and water; brush over puff pastry.
Sprinkle evenly with cheese, thyme, salt, and pepper.
Using a pizza cutter, cut pastry into desired shapes; separate pieces slightly.
Spray a second piece of parchment with cooking spray; place on top of puff pastry, spray-side down.
Roll gently with a rolling pin to press cheese and herbs into pastry.
Transfer puff pastry to a rimmed baking sheet; top with a second rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crackers are golden and crisp, about 15 minutes.
Notes
Peas cook quickly so add them at the very last minute even from frozen so they don't overcook and stay fresh and vibrant.
Other herbs that would work well in this soup are rosemary, tarragon, and oregano.
Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days or can be frozen in suitable containers. You also may need to loosen it with a touch of water, milk or chicken stock you’ll only need around 1/2 cup.
To make this gluten free use GF stock and flour.
Chicken can be replaced with cooked ham or added alongside it.
You could also serve with biscuits or regular puff pastry cut into desired shapes instead of crackers.
