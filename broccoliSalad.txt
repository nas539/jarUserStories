Notes
Get that bacon nice and CRISP and don't forget to toast the pumpkin seeds. 
You can sub in sunflower seeds or almond slivers if preferred or easier to find. 
If you're making this in advance dress the salad as you go for best results.
Dried cranberries or raisins add a nice touch of sweetness.
For those who are not so into the crunch you can blanche the florets in boiling water for 30-60 seconds, then plunge in ice water.
