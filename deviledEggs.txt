Ingredients
6 eggs large
3 tbsp mayonnaise
1 1/2 tsp dijon mustard
1 tsp lemon juice
1 tbsp sour cream optional
2 tsp salt for the boil
2 tsp white vinegar for the boil
Instructions
Place the eggs in a pot with two teaspoons of salt and two teaspoons of vinegar then fill with enough water until the eggs are covered by 1-2 inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and allow to boil for 7 minutes then transfer to an ice bath to cool.
Peel the eggs and cute in half.
Transfer the yolks to a bowl and mix with the mayo, mustard, and lemon juice. You can add salt and pepper to taste at this point if desired.I added a tablespoon of sour cream but you mat want a stiffer filling, I find the sour cream adds a nice mouth feel but it's optional
Either spoon the filling into the eggs or pipe the filling in with a star tip. Sprinkle with paprika and serve. Minced herbs or crumbled bacon can also be added if desired.
