Instructions
INSTRUCTIONS
Cook the onion in a large skillet over medium heat with 2 tbsp olive oil until translucent, add the garlic and cook an additional 2 minutes. 
Add carrot, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper and cook until softened. 
Add Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, 1/3 cup ketchup, chicken stock, oregano, parsley, and thyme, mix and transfer to a bowl to cool.
In a large bowl mix the turkey, eggs, breadcrumbs and onion/herb mixture. (Iâ€™ve found the best way is with clean hands.)
Shape into a rectangular loaf on a lightly oiled baking sheet. 
Brush with the remaining ketchup and place in oven at 375F for about 50 minutes or until internal temperature registered at 170F. 
Put a pan of water on the bottom rack to help prevent cracking.
Garnish with parsley
