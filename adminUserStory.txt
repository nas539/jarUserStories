Everyone in this group is an admin. We may all log in from time to time to see how many users
we have aquired, answer and messages from users who may have a problem, and upload our own
recipes.
Today Ashley logs in because she has recieved an email from a user who noticed a very 
inappropriate recipe from another user. She needs to switch to the admin menu first. She
wants to verify the recipe, and if it is not appropriate she needs to delete the recipie and
send a message to the user "Three strikes and your out!"
She checks the recipe and sees that it does not follow the standards of Jar's recipies. So 
she first needs to delete the recipie. She then notices that this particular user has posted 
foul recipies more than twice. She needs to delete the user.
Ashley's mom also just sent her a recipie for fudge she wants to share. She switches back to
the regular users dashboard, and uploads the recipie.
She then logs out.
