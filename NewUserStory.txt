USER STORY

Wanda is tired of cooking the same thing for dinner every week.
She gets on her computer and searches for recipes. She finds
JarThis. She clicks on the REGISTER BUTTON and it takes her to a
REGISTRATION PAGE. She enters her NAME and EMAIL ADDRESS writes a 
short BIOGRAPHY since it only let her type 150 CHARACTERS. She
then UPLOADED a PROFILE PICTURE. With that being done she pushes
the SUBMIT BUTTON which told her the REGISTRATION WAS SUCCESSFUL
and took her back to the homepage. 

Wanda was very excited to start finding new recipes. She clicked 
on the BROWSE RECIPES BUTTON that took her to a page of all kinds 
of different recipes. There was a POULTY RECIPES BUTTON, BEEF 
RECIPES BUTTON, SEAFOOD RECIPES BUTTON, VEGETARIAN RECIPES 
BUTTON, and even a DESSERTS RECIPES BUTTON. After clicking on all
of them and searching through many amazing recipes, Wanda found
one she really wanted to try so she clicked on the EMPTY JAR ICON
and downloaded it. She new the download was successful when the 
JAR LID CLOSED AND THE JAR FILLED UP. Since she really liked this 
recipe she decided to FOLLOW the author to see what other recipes 
they had shared and perhaps will share in the future. After
looking through a few more recipes, Wanda decides to LOGOUT and 
start cooking.
