George has been using jar for awhile now. When he logs in the app it takes him to hispage, where he can see the most recent recipes of the people he follows. He notices a recipe for lemon blueberry bread he would like to try. He clicks on the jar icon next to the title of the recipe and downloads the file. 
He remembers that he has a dinner party tonight, and had downloaded a rosemary chicken recipe a week ago. He opens his jar, scrolls through and sees the recipe. He opens the file so he can get all the ingrediants ready.
He wants to make a green been casserole with dinner, so he scrolls to the search bar and searches for the recipe. What pops up is a list of recipes for green bean casserole.
George also just created his own recipe for a pound cake. He had typed it out in MS Word, and wanted to share it. He clicks on the "Share recipe" and finds his file to share.
George also lost weight recently and got a new job as a sous chef at a local restaurant, he wanted to update his profile picture and bio to include his new found good looks and job!
When he finishes he makes sure to log out, so no one in his family can find out how he has been making all the wonderful meals he's made them.
